**CDP focuses on documentation**. It does not replace the product pages on www.espressif.com.

## ü§î Why CDP?

You might be wondering ‚Äî why a whole new site?

Currently, Espressif documents are **scattered across multiple platforms**, including:

- www.espressif.com ‚Äì hosting [Technical Documents](https://www.espressif.com/en/support/documents/technical-documents), [PCNs](https://www.espressif.com/en/support/documents/pcns), [Advisories](https://www.espressif.com/en/support/documents/advisories), and [Certificates](https://www.espressif.com/en/support/documents/certificates)
- docs.espressif.com ‚Äì hosting primarily software documents
- Various **GitHub repositories**

**CDP** aims to solve the problem of fragmented information. By consolidating existing resources into a single, unified platform, CDP provides users with a more efficient one-stop documentation experience.

## ‚ú® Key Features of CDP

Here‚Äôs what you can experience on CDP.

### Espressif‚Äôs Technical Documentation in One Place

CDP aims to bring all Espressif‚Äôs technical documentation into one centralized place and has made a significant step towards that goal.

Compared with the old [technical document webpage](https://www.espressif.com/en/support/documents/technical-documents) on [www.espressif.com](https://www.espressif.com), CDP offers many more documents (including English and Chinese versions):

- ~ 800 certificates
- ~ 100 PCNs
- ~ 100 advisories
- ~ 200 software documents

Most of the above-mentioned documents are available in **HTML** format, including those only available in PDF format traditionally:

- Datasheets
- Technical reference manuals (TRMs)
- PCNs and advisories

    >}}

### ChatBot

Need quick answers? Our AI-powered chatbot is here to help!

- You can ask questions in **any language**
- The bot responds **based on Espressif documentation only**
- If the requested information is not available in the documentation, the chatbot will respectfully indicate this to avoid providing inaccurate or speculative responses (hallucinations)
- Each answer includes **references to the source documents**, so you can verify the information

The new search function is designed to help you quickly locate exactly what you need.

- Search **across all documents** or limit the search to the **currently opened document**
- Use **fuzzy search** by default for more flexible matching
- Support **exact match** searches when you check the ‚ÄúExact Match‚Äù option
- Combine search with **filters** for greater precision
- **Automatically correct typos** in your keywords to save time on small mistakes

    >}}

### Comprehensive Filters

Quickly locate the information you need using a powerful and flexible filtering system.

- Filter by **PRODUCT SERIES** to find documents for a particular chip series
- Use **CATEGORIES** to narrow down to specific software or hardware groups
- Toggle **Show EOL Products** to view documents for end-of-life products
- Select by **DOCUMENT TYPE** (e.g., datasheet, manual, certificate, PCN, etc.) to find exactly what you need

### Collection of User Feedback

## üîÆ What‚Äôs Next?

We have some more features coming! Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs coming next:

- Subscription to documents
- A more polished experience of **homepage, filters, etc**.
- Continued improvements based on your **feedback**
- **Redirecting and retiring older pages**:

    - Pages for [Technical Documents](https://www.espressif.com/en/support/documents/technical-documents), [PCNs](https://www.espressif.com/en/support/documents/pcns), [Advisories](https://www.espressif.com/en/support/documents/advisories), and [Certificates](https://www.espressif.com/en/support/documents/certificates) on [www.espressif.com](https://www.espressif.com) will be closed by the end of 2025, assuming no major issues are found. After that point, traffic to those pages will be **automatically redirected to CDP**.
    - For now, content on platforms like docs.espressif.com and GitHub will **continue to be updated in parallel** with CDP. No shutdown date is currently set for those platforms.

## üí¨ We Need Your Feedback!
